## Physical Layer
- Ensures the transmission and reception of raw bit frames through a physical medium.

## Data Link Layer
- Ensures the transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by the physical layer.
-  It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.

IEEE 802 divides the data link layer into two sublayers:[28]

* Medium access control (MAC) layer – responsible for controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit data.

* Logical link control (LLC) layer – responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls error checking and frame synchronization.

## Network Layer
- Responsible for the structuring and managing of a multinode network through addressing, routing and traffic control.
- t is the function of the payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the protocol that carries them.

## Transport Layer
- The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destination host from one application to another across a network, while maintaining the quality-of-service functions. 

## Session Layer
- The session layer creates the setup, controls the connections, and ends the teardown, between two or more computers, which is called a "session".

## Applicatio Layer
- Application-layer functions typically include file sharing, message handling, and database access, through the most common protocols at the application layer, known as HTTP, FTP, SMB/CIFS, TFTP, and SMTP. When identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit.

- A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.[1] By contrast, a wide area network (WAN) not only covers a larger geographic distance, but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits.


- The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices.
